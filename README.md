Certainly! To create a simple Termux command for the chess game, you can follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Clone the repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fahadmuhammed123/termux-chess.git
   ```

   Navigate into the cloned directory:

   ```bash
   cd termux-chess
   ```

2. **Edit the `package.json` file:**

   Open the `package.json` file in a text editor. Add or update the `"bin"` field to create a custom command. For example, you can add the following:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "termux-chess",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "description": "A simple text-based chess game for Termux",
     "main": "chess.js",
     "bin": {
       "termux-chess": "./chess.js"
     },
     "scripts": {
       "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
     },
     "keywords": ["termux", "chess"],
     "author": "Your Name",
     "license": "ISC",
     "dependencies": {
       "readline-sync": "^1.4.10"
     }
   }
   ```

   Ensure that the `"bin"` field points to the correct script (`chess.js`).

3. **Make the Script Executable:**

   Make sure the script (`chess.js`) is executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x chess.js
   ```

4. **Install the Command:**

   Install the command globally using:

   ```bash
   npm link
   ```

   This command will create a symbolic link, allowing you to run `termux-chess` from anywhere in the Termux environment.

5. **Run the Chess Game:**

   You can now run the chess game using the custom command:

   ```bash
   termux-chess
   ```

   Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

Remember that this is a basic setup, and you might want to enhance it based on your specific requirements. Additionally, if you plan to distribute this command, you may want to consider proper versioning, documentation, and more extensive testing.
